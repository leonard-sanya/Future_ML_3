This project predicts student scores based on the number of study hours using Linear Regression.

## Installation
Inorder to run this implementation, clone the repository by running:

-       git clone https://github.com/leonard-sanya/Future_ML_3.git
  
## Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

-     pip install -r requirements.txt
And finally run:
-       python main.py
The script will train a Linear Regression model on the dataset and output prediction results. The trained model will also save images in the output_images folder.
